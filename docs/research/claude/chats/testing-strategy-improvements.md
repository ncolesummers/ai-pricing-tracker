# Implementation Plan for Testing Improvements

## 1. Create Test Fixtures Directory Structure

First, I'll set up a proper structure for our test fixtures:

```
tests/
├── fixtures/
│   ├── html/
│   │   ├── anthropic_pricing.html    # HTML fixture for Anthropic's pricing page
│   │   └── openai_pricing.html       # HTML fixture for OpenAI's pricing page
│   └── data/
│       ├── valid_pricing.json        # Valid pricing data example
│       ├── invalid_pricing.json      # Invalid pricing data examples
│       └── edge_case_pricing.json    # Edge cases for validation testing
├── test_integration/
│   └── test_scraper_integration.py   # Integration tests for scrapers
├── test_validation/
│   └── test_pricing_validation.py    # Tests for validation logic
└── test_property/
    └── test_pricing_properties.py    # Property-based tests
```

## 2. Implement Integration Tests with Mocked Web Responses

The integration tests will use realistic HTML fixtures to test scraper parsing:

1. Capture real HTML responses from provider websites
2. Create HTML fixtures with representative pricing tables
3. Use `unittest.mock` to inject these fixtures into scraper tests
4. Test all scraper methods against these fixtures
5. Add specific edge cases like missing price data, different pricing formats

## 3. Develop Comprehensive Data Validation Tests

For validation testing, I'll create tests for:

1. Valid data scenarios with complete pricing information
2. Missing required fields (last_updated, providers, models)
3. Empty model lists for providers
4. Price validation - too low, too high, zero values
5. Invalid/inconsistent currency formatting
6. Timestamp validation and format checking

## 4. Implement Property-Based Testing

Using Hypothesis for property-based testing:

1. Add hypothesis to requirements-dev.txt
2. Create property tests for core pricing calculations
3. Define strategies for generating diverse inputs
4. Test mathematical properties like:
   - Scaling (doubling tokens doubles cost)
   - Boundary behavior (zero tokens = zero cost)
   - Additivity (cost of A + cost of B = cost of A+B)

## 5. Update Requirements and Documentation

Finally, I'll update:

1. requirements-dev.txt to include necessary packages:
   ```
   pytest>=7.0.0
   hypothesis>=6.0.0
   pytest-cov>=4.0.0
   ```

2. Add testing documentation in README.md:
   ```markdown
   ## Testing Strategy
   
   The project uses multiple testing approaches:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests with mocked web responses
   - Data validation tests
   - Property-based testing for mathematical correctness
   
   To run the tests:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pytest
   
   # Run with coverage report
   pytest --cov=ai_pricing_tracker
   
   # Run only property-based tests
   pytest tests/test_property/
   ```
   ```
